# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```



## MEEP 

- Deployed a smart contract, created contract with basic functions (mint, transfer, approve,..)
- Created a Dapp to visualize token's supply, user balance of the token and buttons to mint new tokens, transfer tokens, approve spender
